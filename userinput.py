# create variable called greeting that holds the value of a string
greetings = "Hello Ninja!"
print greetings
# you can use single or double quotes for strings
print 'What is your name?'
# we use raw_input()to get user input and set it to a variable
name = raw_input()
print "How old are you?"
# we can also use input() to get user input
age = input()
# adding of variables to a string to be printed is like this:
print "Your name is", name
print "You are", age, "years old"
# you can also add the variable in between strings just like the above
raw_input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
# the line above would make the app not close or exit out automatically.
